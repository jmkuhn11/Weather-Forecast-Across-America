# Weather-Forecast-Across-America

## Description
This code was developed for a traveler wanting their own source for determining the upcoming weather of multiple destinations. Through creating this application, I gained a better understanding of how to incorporate server-side API's into my coding. I also continue to develop stylizing using Web API's and javascript, trying to get more experience outside of css.

## Installation
Bootstrap

Working with openweathermap.org API

## Usage
A user will load the page and be promted to enter the city destination they are curious about for the weather. Ater entering it, they will be shown the current date's temperature, wind speed, and humidity. They will also have a little icon to depict the kind of wheather being had (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.). This same information will also be shown for the following 5 days, so the user can plan accordingly for the upcoming week. The user can then enter another city name, and be shown the weather for another place. Each entry will be saved underneath the search bar. Thus, if the user needs to check the same city again, they have quick and easy access.
